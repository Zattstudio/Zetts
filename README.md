# Zetts
A minimal, self-contained application for studying vocab or two-column data

# Sets
Sets are stored in the **sets** folder. Files are saved with the extension **.set** but **.csv** should also work just fine.
Set files are standard csv files with the first row containing metadata. The first row should look like this:
"{Set name}","{Date}","{Author}"

# Modes
The application has two modes. The user can choose between the modes "Flashcards" and "Learn".

## Flashcards Mode
The data is sorted like in the original file and cards are displayed.

## Learn Mode
This mode implements a simple algorithm for learning by utilizing a value for each row that tells the system whether the user has already answered this row correctly.
